\section{Value iteration in MDPs}

The different implementations of Value Iteration have been verified using the $Q^{*}$ provided for the \emph{loadunload} problem. They match exactly within the accuracy of the reference matrix.

\subsubsection*{Rewards}

The average sums of discounted rewards and relevant standard deviations (between parenthesis) have been visualised in \ref{table:rewards}. 
They are the result of 100 runs with a horizon of 100 steps.
The results for \emph{MLS} and \emph{$Q_{MDP}$} will be further discussed in the next section.

A brief comparison between the results for the \emph{Initial Start Distribution} and the \emph{Fully Observable} implementations shows that the latter produces slightly smaller reward values. 
The main reason is that a horizon chosen at 100 steps still somewhat limits the maximal achievable reward.

\subsubsection*{Performance statistics}

The algorithm for \emph{Value Iteration} presented in the slides was implemented with a few minor modifications for performance reasons. 
Looping is first done over actions and then nested the different states. To exploit the sparsity of some of the matrices the Matlab \emph{find()} function is used.

To optimize the calculation of the $Q^{*}$ matrices a second implementation was done where the fetching of the non-zero elements from sparse matrices is done up front. 
The average running time and standard deviation of running times in seconds for \emph{Value Iteration} can be found in table \ref{table:vi}.
Here the new algorithm is the modified version with fetching before the actual loops.
