Installation instructions for approximate POMDP solving software

This software has been developed with Matlab 6.5 (R13) under Linux, I
haven't tried any other releases or platforms.

The algorithm needs to find the generic/ directory, so add it to your
Matlab path:
  addpath CWD/generic
where CWD is the current directory. You can put this in
~/matlab/startup.m for convenience.

The software saves results in the directory returned by getDataDir.m,
you might want to customize this function if you're not satisfied with
the default (which is the current directory, '.').
